    "title": "Who's still afraid of fear? A workshop about anxiety.",
    "summary": "A long, long time ago, our ancestors were in constant danger. In this environment an adaptive emotion evolved, that allowed them to forsee and react to threats - anxiety. Even though nowdays we rarely find ourselves in mortal danger, we are \"stuck\" with an excitable mind that is quickly overwhelmed by fear. Today anxiety is recognized as a leading psychological disorder. In this workshop we will learn about the nature of this disorder and how to prevent it.",
